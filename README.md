## Guide Me

this project is bootstraped with **`ReactJS`** and   **`Tomtom maps api`**

> **Note:** since the Google Maps API requires billing account, and I don't have oneðŸ˜…. hence, used Tomtom api for maps.


### Features
- `responsive` for smaller screens.
- used modular coding style
- BEM(Block Element Modifier) standards were followed, while naming css classes.
- Exposure to APIs, other than Google Maps API. (TomTom api).
